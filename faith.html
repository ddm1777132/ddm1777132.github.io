            I have grown up in a Christian household. I was raised going to church every Sunday. But that is not what makes my faith real. It was very recently that I found God. Even though I was constantly in a Christian atmosphere, I never really understood what a true relationship with God was like. There are many things that led to my salvation, but it's a lot to get in to. To keep it short, life at the time was rough and I did not know how to get out of the situation. But, for some reason, God showed himself to me and I instantly realized how real He was in my life. From that moment on I have put my faith in Christ and trusted Him with my life. I believe that my purpose is to show God's love to those around me so that they might find salvation through Him as I did. I know that God has made my paths straight and that He will never leave me nor forsake me.

             I believe that God is a supernatural being, one that is all-knowing, all-powerful and loving above all things. God is love, it says so in His word in 1 John 4:8 and 1 John 4:16, “God is love…”. His nature itself is loving, but not just loving, he is also compassionate, merciful, gracious and so much more! We as Christians also believe that God is the creator of the entire universe. We believe that he hovered as a spirit over the earth in its darkest form. Yet, believe that God is three things in one being. The first one is that he is God the Father. He is our father and the Father of the Son. The Son is the one who came down and died for us here on earth to save our sins. The third one is God the Spirit.
            We believe that there is and always has been one God (1 Corinthians 8:4 ESV) 
            There will never be enough words to describe how awesome our God is. And for such a person to love us as his crowning glory of creation should feel amazing! God has done many things to reveal himself. He delivered the Israelites from the Egyptians, he turned water into wine and he died on the cross to save us! Even though we were the ones that surely deserved death, he cares about us and we should acknowledge him for all the blessing he bestows upon our lives. One of the many blessings God has given us is this earth, his creation.
            Christians believe that God created the universe in one of two specific ways. The first way is that he created things by just speaking and things appeared right then and there. In doing this he took exactly seven days. The second way we believe the world was created was that God took seven metaphorical days to create the universe, meaning that each day could have been millions of years and that he could have taken his time to perfect each and everything that he made. The message of creation is to reveal God to mankind and to make his name known throughout the world, according to Romans 1:18-20. God has created mankind in his image and we are his crowning glory. God wanted something in his creation to resemble him. We as Christians also believe that when God created the universe, it was all good. He did not have to go back and rework things because God cannot create anything imperfect. But now his creation is tainted with sin because of us.
            Sin. What is sin? To commit a sin is to break any of the Lord’s laws (Ex. 20). In our world today; ever since Adam and Eve sinned, sin has existed all around us. Everything in God’s creation, because of a bad decision, is affected by sin. Even the good things that do great things, were all created with a hint of sin. The world that God initially creates is without sin until The Fall  Things in creation bring death and sickness, that is an effect of sin in this world. The phrase total depravity says we as humans cannot possibly do such a deed that would bring us salvation. In John 14:6 NIV, it says, “...No one shall come to the Father except through me…”. Jesus is explaining how we as followers of Christ get to heaven. He says that we cannot get to God except through Jesus. 
            I believe that Jesus is part of the Trinity as the son. We believe that Jesus is both God and human. We believe that he came down to build his kingdom here on earth and to take up our sins so that we may be cleansed of our evil. Jesus is also the only person to have walked the earth that was perfect throughout his entire life. He never did anything wrong. Not even the slightest sinful inclination in his thoughts. Why did Jesus have to be perfect? Well, a majority of the things Jesus does he did to fulfill prophecy. He had to be perfect otherwise he would not have been a blameless sacrifice for our sins. He had to die so that the sin of this world would die with him and it would be no more. 
            Each day, I take the death of my savior for granted. I rarely think about it and I don’t always consider the benefits of it that allow me to be who I am today. The death and crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a reminder to us that we are saved as long as we put our faith solely in him. 
            The third part of the Trinity is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has existed since Genesis 1:2. It says, “Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.” We believe that the Holy Spirit is all around us here on earth. We believe that when we accept Jesus as our savior that the Holy Spirit comes into our hearts and dwells in us until we die. Once the Holy Spirit comes into us it will never leave. That is a very relieving thing to know because we are confident that our salvation cannot be lost.
