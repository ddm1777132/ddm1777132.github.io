                        This book report was the best paper I wrote all year. This paper helped me to better 
                        understand how to structure my essays. Throughout my high school career, I have developed
                        good writing skills. I can write fluidly and can make my writing fun and interesting for the 
                        reader. I learned how to catch a reader's attention and to keep them reading throughout the 
                        paper.

                            The Alice in Wonderland play during my Junior year was a great accomplishment and experience for me.
                            I played the role of the King of Hearts. The original student who was assigned this role never showed 
                            up to practices.

                                        The day before the first performance, I happened to be in the same room and was asked 
                                        to fill in the role temporarily. 
                                        I went up with my script and actually did very well. Ms. Begay ended up 
                                        asking me to take over the role! Being me I said yes, 
                                        however, I didn't have much time to memorize my lines 
                                        and practice. So I memorized them two hours before the play the next day after school! 
                                        Participating in the play further enhanced my "on-the-spot" creative ability. It taught me to be expressive 
                                        in my speech. During the time I was filling in for the King, I had to read from the script, and make the character
                                        interesting using my improv skills. I was forced to think quickly to solve a problem and in the end, I was awarded
                                        with the role of the King of Hearts.
