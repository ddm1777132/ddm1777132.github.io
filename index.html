        <p id="p1">
            I was born in Cambodia. At seven months old, my parents adopted me and took me to their home in Illinois. 
            A year later, they adopted my younger sister from the Philippines. I began my educational career at 
            Huddleston Elementary School; just a five minute walk from my house. However, it was cut short for a 
            while since my dad got a new job offer in Singapore. We moved to Singapore and lived there for about a year. 
            After Singapore came Timor Leste. Again, we stayed there for a year. After that we moved to Malawi, Africa, 
            where we lived for three and a half years. Finally, after living overseas for 8 years, we moved back to the 
            United states to the small town of Gallup, New Mexico. Iâ€™ve lived in many different places with many diverse 
            people and cultures.

            I picked up the hobby for photography so I could have something to do for family vacations.
            I love taking nature pictures. Capturing the outdoors in a picture helps me to appreciate the world
            around me.

            My Outdoor Lifestyle
        </h1>

        <p id="p1">
            I've always loved the outdoors and spending time in the world God has designed for us. 
            I'm a very 'hands-on' type of person, so climbing is one of the best things for me to do
            when I'm outside. When I am out and about in nature, that is when I feel closest to God.
            Knowing that he created the world and everything in it, I feel like I am in a special place that 
            God has created for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Climbing has become a frequently chosen activity for me in my free time. It helps me to relax and it clears my mind 
            of any stress that's in my head. Climbing has also been really fun because I climb with my best friend Josh Byker.
            It's always a good time.
        </p>
