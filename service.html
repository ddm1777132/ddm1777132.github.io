                    Choir Tour
                </h4>

                    <p>
                        I have been a part of the choir since eighth grade. Being in choir has helped me develop my musical talent. The most memorable thing from all my years in choir is the tours that we went on. The most recent tour we went on was to Port Arthur, Texas. We helped people there with hurricane relief. The service team that I was in helped tear down a church so they could rebuild. We also helped move and sort supplies that would be distributed to different people around the community.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        This tour helped me discover that I really enjoy helping others. Not only through the songs that we sang, but also through the things we did to show God's love to the people around us. Throughout the trip it was brought to my attention that such satisfying joy can come from helping others. Especially those who are really struggling.

                    Mascot
                </h4>

                    <p>
                        I decided to be the school mascot for the basketball games during my senior year. Representing my school and bringing excitement to the games has been one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Being the mascot has taught me good leadership skills. I learned the best way to get the fans in the bleachers to get excited about the game and I was able to keep them into what was going on. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Being the school mascot also taught me that what other people think of me doesn't matter. During the first games I was hesistant to be the mascot. But, as the games progressed I became more comfortable. Before no time I was running around and doing flips and cart-wheels in front of everyone.
